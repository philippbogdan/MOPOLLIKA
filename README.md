# Philipp Bogdan

Building at the intersection of **AI**, **wearables**, and **real-world applications**.

## Featured Projects

### [MyEntropy](https://github.com/philippbogdan/myentropy)
**Cognitive entropy tracker** that measures how fragmented your day is based on context-switching between activities.

- **Web App** (Python/Flask) - Calendar-based entropy visualization with LLM-powered activity classification
- **iOS App** (Swift/SwiftUI) - Real-time activity detection via Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses
- **Core Engine** - Shannon entropy calculations with switch penalty algorithms

```
High entropy = scattered, fragmented day
Low entropy = focused, deep work blocks
```

**Tech:** Swift, SwiftUI, Meta Wearables DAT SDK, Flask, Google Calendar API, Grok API

### [Beaconn](https://github.com/philippbogdan/Beaconn)
**Civilian Emergency Response Coordination System** - matches help requests with nearby volunteers during disasters.

- Real-time geospatial matching using PostGIS
- LLM-powered guidance generation for callers and helpers
- Multi-model AI strategy (Haiku for quick responses, Sonnet for complex analysis)
- Full audit trails for accountability

**Tech:** FastAPI, React, TypeScript, PostgreSQL/PostGIS, AWS Bedrock, LangChain
